## What is Docker?

Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization, also known as “containerization”.

### So what is containerization or container?

Containerization is a lightweight alternative to full machine virtualization that involves encapsulating an application in a container with its own operating environment.

So Suppose, for instance, that two apps both use Node but have various versions. In a solitary setting, they may run beside one another without interfering with one another.

so we can say that container is a isolated environment for running an application.

No, Docker is not a VM. Docker is a containerization platform which packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers so as to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment be it development or test or production.
